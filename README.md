# Capstone Project

## Perfume Ratings


This model predicts the value of rating score for perfumes.
Utilising this kind of predictions, can help to create better communication between manufactures, sellers and customers.

### Executive Summary

Start with one or two sentences here that contextualises what your project matters here.
These two sentences will demonstrate your business understanding. 

Next, in a second paragraph, write how you were able to make a data science operationalization of the problem.
For example, you might say that in order to help solve this problem you set out to build a classification ML model in order to automate some process. 

Third, you then write what you did on the project that is a bit more technical.
Here you might say that you took data from [here and make it a link to the original data]() and then ran `a list of models you ran here` in your analysis.
Then end with one sentence that picks what your best model was and how it performed.

Lastly, you say in one or two sentences why this matters. 
For example, now as opposed to before this data analysis, you can now predict X better than Y. 

The goal of this project was to create a `regression/classification` model that was able to predict `what you set out to do`.

> If you are able to swap out the text here with what your case example is you will demonstrate the following:
> 1. You get why what you're doing 'matters'
> 2. You are able to take ill defined problems and turn them into something a data scienst can solve
> 3. You show off your analystical and modeling chops.
> 4. You are able to communicate technical things you do.

### More Information

Below your Executive Summary, you can document whatever you feel would be of interest to a future employer.
Here I would especially suggest diving a bit deeper into your methodology and including images that you are proud of from the project. 
Remember, that people will probably judge your github project page within 45 seconds tops, you want it to look as clean as possible. 

Write documentation that looks like someone you would want to work with.
